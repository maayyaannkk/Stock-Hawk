# Stock-Hawk

Android App to Track your stocks

In this project, I have productionized an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. 
To do this, I had to find and handle error cases, add accessibility features, allow for localization, add widgets, and add a library.

##How to Install

###Requirements

Java 7/8 Latest version of Android SDK and Android Build Tools API Key

Just clone the repo and compile it with Android Studio: Yahoo Finance's APIs don't require an API key.

Credits to Yahoo for their Finance's APIs.

###Building

You can build the app with Android Studio or with ./gradlew assembleDebug command.
